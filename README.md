## Expected Outcome:

1. When the npm run start command is ran from the root directory, the application should start up the backend and serve the client.
2. The JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.
3. When the webpack plugins are ran, there's a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
4. When the user uses the next-gen JavaScript in the application, the text editor still functions in the browser without error.
5. When the user opens the text editor, the IndexDB has immediately created a database storage.
6. Content is saved in the IndexDB after clicking off od the DOM window.
7. The install buttom downloads the web app as an icon on my desktop.
